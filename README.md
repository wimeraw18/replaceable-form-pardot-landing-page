# Replaceable Form in Pardot Landing Pages

## including instructions for user in the editor

### This code snippet allows Pardot users to change forms on landing pages without having to worry about the form's layout template being overridden by the landing page's layout template.

### Practically speaking, this allows a user-friendly way to swap or replace Pardot forms and their styles in any landing page, right in the content editor.

### When the user clicks on "form-iframe-code" in the content editor, they will be prompted with an area to paste the iframe code of the desired Pardot form. Within that prompt, are instructions to assist the user.

### Once the user follows the instructions, their landing page will now have a perfectly sized and styled Pardot form on their landing page that can easily be replaced with another one at any given time.
